    <h1>Beer marinated pork</h1>
    <p>On the Viking farm in Ribe VikingeCenter we have cows, sheep, horses, pigs, chickens and geese. Still, the Viking diet doesn't consist of much meat.

        Cows, sheep and horses were mainly kept for their milk, wool just as they served as labour and means of transport. As it was difficult to do without these animals, it was quite rare that they would be slaughtered. However, when it did happen, the farmer knew how to get the most out of the animals and made use of everything, like e.g. the bones, skins and horns.
        
        The pig was the only domestic animal kept just for the meat, and people loved pork. Pigs and lambs were usually slaughtered in the autumn, and it was a challenge to preserve the meat and keep it for a longer period of time. The odd cockerel or a goose for Yule was also appreciated by most, just like plenty of fish and shellfish from the Wadden Sea.</p>
