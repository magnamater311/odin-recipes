    <h1><p>Doesn't this huge pic of Nackerel Omelette make your mouth water!</p></h1>
    <p>Outdoor cooking is made easy with this method as you won't need any other heavy equipment. You just need a fire, a plank and some wooden nails. Never use pine for your plank, though. The resin will ruin your fish/meat.
        Frida has gathered samphire on the Wadden Sea coast. With some farm eggs and a couple of mackerels that have been smoked over the fire in the Longhouse, she is going to make a delicious omelette.

        Samphire can be eaten raw or cooked. It is very salty as it grows on the saltmarsh and beach which is regularly flooded. Pick the tender and bright green shoots and have them with fish, egg, in salads or simply just stir-fried. Samphire can also be dried and chopped very finely as a substitute for salt.
        For this recipe we use salmon, wild garlic and spring onion, but you can easily change the ingredients with other types of fish, meat and herbs. Flatfish with fresh thyme, mackarel with summer savory and seaweed salt, and chicken with marjoram are three examples.</p>
